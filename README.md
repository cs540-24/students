I'm Mengling He, and I am a first year Ph.D. student majored in Data Science and Engineering. 
I have a master's degree of  Statistics, my previous background is mostly data and statistics, so I choose this course to gain knowledge about software engineering.
My coding is not as good as other C.S. students since I had a hard time last semester in the Machine Learning class, but I learnt it hard and got a good results.
I hope in this class we don't need to do too many big projects, but can learn the pipeline through the projects.
