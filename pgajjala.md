Hi, I am Anirudh Gajjala! I am currently pursuing my 2nd Year Master's in Computer Science, set to graduate in Spring 2024. I am interested in taking this class because I wanted to build more upon the foundational knowledge that I gained when I worked on some Machine Learning and Data Mining projects previously during my undergrad. I as well took the Data Mining class offered by Dr. Taufer during the previous Spring semester and as well have done an internship in Data Engineering over the summer. I as well took Dr. Mockus's 545, Fundamentals of Digital Archealogy. So, I am looking forward to explore more along this career path and this class is going to be a stepping stone for it, as I am trying to get a full-time job this semester. Looking forward to getting to know you all during the semester!
