My name is Bibek Poudel and I am a Ph.D. student in the EECS department. I work in Fluidic City Lab, where my research interests are at the intersection of reinforcement learning and autonomy in transportation systems. I have taken  a Software Engineering course before and enjoyed it very much. From this course, I hope to learn something useful that I will be using for the rest of my career.
