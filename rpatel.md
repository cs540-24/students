My name is Richa Patel.I completed my Computer Science graduation in 2015, and since then, I have had minimal interaction with technology. 
Now, I am eager to re-engage with the field and enhance my practical knowledge to grow as a software engineer. 
The rapidly evolving landscape of technology motivates me to stay current and contribute meaningfully to the ever-changing world of software development.
